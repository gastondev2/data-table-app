# Getting Started with DataTable app

THis project is a simple DataTable connected with a public API (Rick and Morty).
The intial data is fetched and load in the datatable and the user can easily delete, sort and filter data.

Disclaimer: Edit data is not developed for timing.

The Datatable component could be easily extended to accept a generic endpoint API, a list of columns and basic functions to perform
operations and then we could make it usable for ANY data origin.

## Installation

```bash

git clone https://github.com/gastondev2/data-table-app.git
cd data-table-app
npm run i
npm run start

```
We should see it running on: http://localhost:3000/
